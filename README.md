# linear_classifiers
Implemented Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and SGD with proper scaling and regularization. Compared decision boundaries, training dynamics, and coefficient-based interpretability, and outlined strategies for imbalance and hyperparameter tuning in fast, production-friendly models.
